# Enron
Using Python with Scikit-Learn and ML algorithms to study the famous Enron Email Corpus. 
Goal was to determine whethera person in the data set is a person of interest (poi) based on their other features.
Utilized K-Best algorithm to determine which features should be kept and discarded. 
Created new features based on ratio of messages to and from pois, and tested those features using Decision Tree and GNB. 
Decision Tree ultimately had better precision and recall so that algorithm was used.
